# P1_VideoEncodingUpf

That's the first Lab of the Video part of Audio and Video Coding made by Victor Zald√≠var.
This lab consist in working with python scripts in some encoding and compression methods and also working with ffmpeg throught the terminal Ubuntu.
Exercices 2 and 3 are made by using ffmpeg and you can find the corresponding files attached of the original image, the rendered image and a capture of the terminal about the 
command used to obtain the result. 
I notice that the best way to compress an image it's converted to a .jpeg or .jpeg instead of .png or others.
The comments of the python scripts about the other exercices are inside the coorresponding scripts.
